#Task1
Even or Odd Number Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks whether a user-input number is even or odd.
ðŸ’¡ How It Works

    The program prompts the user to enter a number.

    It converts the input into an integer.

    It checks if the number is divisible by 2.

        If it is, the number is even.

        Otherwise, it is odd.
